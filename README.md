Need to create a GitHub personal access token, leaving all of the default permissions as they are. The way that it's was introduced to us, came with .env.EXAMPLE you want to change this to a working .env ONLY.

Then, need to complete code the ```CandidatesSearch.tsx``` and ```SavedCandidates.tsx``` page as well as ```Nav.tsx```. To make the page display properly, as the demo describes.

Also, we need to make sure that all of the unnecessary stuff, is blocked out ```.gitignore```. We need to make buttons for the minus (-), plus (+), which will go in the ```public/images/``` folder, and that will affect, CandidateSearch.tsx especially. We could have used an interface, the interface Candidate in CandidateSearch.tsx, for clarification.
